There is one user led on this board on pin PB1.

This example blinks that led, 3 blinks, pause, 3 blinks, pause...No
timer is used, the code counts to a big number to kill time then
changes the led state.

If this is your first cortex-m3 I hopefully have better information in
my mbed_samples repo (also at github) look at the first few blinkers.

This example is in C with some asm to get things started.  Both gcc
and llvm's clang are used to create various flavors of binaries from
the same source.  The code is quite trivial but this hopefully creates
a foundation of how to use these tools for an environment like this.
