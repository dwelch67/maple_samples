See the top level README for documentation and schematics for this board.

There is one user led on this board on pin PB1.

The Cortex-m3 has its own built in system timer, which is super easy
to use.  It is a 24 bit timer running at the processor clock.  Which
was a bit fast, so am using clock/8 and watching for 0x800000 ticks
it is about 8 seconds.  Basically it is looking like it is an 8MHz clock
which makes sense, the schematic shows an 8MHz crystal, so I assume
we are running off of that crystal without any multipliers.

Press the reset button, there are fast blinks then some slow ones
during the slow ones run this command:

dfu-util -c 1 -i 0 -a 1 -D blinker02.gcc.thumb.bin

And it will load the program into the maple mini.

Press reset again and let it run and after some fast then slower blinks
it goes into our program which changes the led state about every 8
seconds.
