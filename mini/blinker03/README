See the top level README for documentation and schematics for this board.

This is derived from prior blinker examples, blinker01 and blinker02,
refer to those for more information.  This example uses a general purpose
timer TIM2.

This particular flavor of STM32F103 does not have every peripheral described
in the datasheet for these STM32F1xx parts.  The datasheet says three
general purpose timers and one advanced timer.  Through trial and
error TIM2, TIM3, and TIM4 work, TIM5 does not so that make sense three
of them work as described in the datasheet.
