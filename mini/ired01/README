See the top level README for documentation and schematics for this board.

This is an infrared example as in infrared remote controls for your tv or
whatever.  I am using this receiver:

And some jumper wires like these

Use the datasheet for the part to see the pinout.  For the maple looking
at the top of the board (where you can see the led), with the usb connector
pointed up, the top left corner is vcc, next pin down is ground and
two pins after that has a 15 label on it.  I have vcc and ground in the
obvious places and the pin marked 15 is connected to the output pin of
the ir receiver.

This example simply demonstrates that it works, and we can receive
something by checking the high/low status of the input pin then
turning on or off the led in a tight loop.  When you point a remote
control at it and press a button the led should blink.
