See the top level README for documentation and schematics for this board.

This demonstrates the use of the IWDG independent watchdog timer.

Looking at the manual a PR divisor value of 3 (divide by 32) and a reload
value of 0xFFF gives 3276.8 ms which is 3.2768 seconds.

So if we dont do anything after starting the watchdog the chip will reset
in 3 seconds.

That is what this example does, starts the watchdog timer and does nothing,
you should see the board reset and go through the stock bootloaders
blinky light pattern.  Since that takes about a second it should
reboot every 4 seconds.
