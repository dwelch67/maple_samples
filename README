---- mini ----

To get schematics you need to go here

git clone git://github.com/leaflabs/maplemini.git

The microcontroller is an STM32F103CBT6, you want to go here

http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/product/189782.jsp

And get the reference manual RM0008

http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/REFERENCE_MANUAL/CD00171190.pdf

Start with the blinker01 example and go from there.

My mbed_samples repo has a lot of text written about getting and how
to use the compilers.  My raspberry pi repo has a build_gcc script
for building your own gnu based ARM cross compiler toolchain from
sources.

---- bootloader ----

The maple bootloader is found here

git clone git://github.com/leaflabs/maple-bootloader.git

It supports dfu, I have had success using this version of dfu-util

http://gitorious.org/~tormod/unofficial-clones/dfuse-dfu-util

In this manner:

dfu-util -c 1 -i 0 -a 1 -D myprogram.bin

You have to press the reset button and you give it a second then
have a few seconds to run dfu-util before it tries to run your
user application.  Once loaded then press reset again and let it
run.
